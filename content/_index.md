title: Resources for Scholarly Communications Librarians
---

Websites for scholarly publications and digital scholarship are expected to be stable for long-term access, citation, and archiving. Static websites provide a durable and low-cost solution for making and distributing scholarly works. 

In library and academic contexts, static websites have been used for [conference websites](https://2020.code4lib.org/), [digitization projects](https://ocul.on.ca/topomaps/), [archival metadata](http://hillelarnold.com/staticAid/), [academic journals](http://archipelagosjournal.org/), [edited monographs](https://www.getty.edu/publications/mummyportraits/), and [open textbooks](https://moderndive.com/). 

These resources introduce this powerful technology for scholarly communications librarianship. 

## Contents

- A [lesson plan](/teaching-resources/lesson-plan/) for learning about static web publishing for digital scholarship projects.
- An [annotated bibliography](/teaching-resources/bibiliography/) of articles, tutorials, and podcasts about static websites in academic contexts.
- A [quick demonstration](/tutorials/github/) of GitHub as a static website hosting platform 
- An [introduction to static site generators](/tutorials/static-site-generators/) tutorial
