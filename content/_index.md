title: Resources for Scholarly Communications Librarians
---

Static websites are useful for helping scholars publish academic and educational information online. Unlike conventional publishing platforms or services, static websites involve much lower hosting and maintenance costs. The trade-off, however, is that it takes a bit more technical knowledge to get started. These resources are here to help with getting started. 

**Contents:**

- An [annotated bibliography](/bibiliography/) of writings and examples for anyone interested in learning about how static websites work and reading about examples of static websites in academic contexts. 

- A [lesson plan](/lesson-plan/) containing key concepts and activities on how static websites relate to scholarly communications librarianship.

- A step-by-step [tutorial](/tutorial/) on making static websites for library-publishing scenarios. 

## Introduction

### What makes static websites appealing?

- They support a variety of digital scholarship and scholarly communications use cases: scholarly monographs, academic journals, digital exhibits, reproducible research, open educational resources, data visualizations, and digital library projects. 

- They are built on open source software and open web standards. There's nothing proprietary to the underlying technologies.

- They can be hosted anywhere, enabling the freedom to deploy to (and migrate from) any hosting provider. 

- They rely on less infrastructure than traditional platforms: no databases, no software updates, no server maintenance, no security patches, and thus:

- They are cheaper to maintain and preserve.

### What are the drawbacks?

- They are more difficult to learn. Static websites don't typically include a content management system with an intuitive user interface. Instead, they require direct interaction with files and folders via a text editor and command line interface. On team projects, it makes sense to leave the website work to very few people.

- They are more difficult to edit after the work is complete. For scholarly publications and digital scholarship projects, frequent editing and updating may not be a primary concern, but projects involving many content editors with on-the-fly content updates may be better served by a publishing platform with a content management system. 

- They do not support "logged in" user experiences. Static websites are easiest to make when they are public and read-only. Administrative dashboards, analytics, submission management systems, and subscriber content would need to be handled elsewhere. 

_Note: Some of these drawbacks may actually be benefits._
