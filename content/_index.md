title: Resources for Scholarly Communications Librarians
---

Websites for scholarly publications and digital scholarship are expected to be stable for long-term access, citation, and archiving. Static websites provide the durable and low-cost solution for making and distributing scholarly works. In academic contexts, static websites have been used for [conference websites](https://2020.code4lib.org/), [digitization projects](https://ocul.on.ca/topomaps/), [archival metadata](http://hillelarnold.com/staticAid/), [academic journals](http://archipelagosjournal.org/), [edited monographs](https://www.getty.edu/publications/mummyportraits/), and [open textbooks](https://moderndive.com/). Unlike conventional web publishing platforms or services, static websites involve much lower hosting and maintenance costs. This helps libraries sustain them over long periods of time. The trade-off, however, is that it takes a bit more technical knowledge to get started. These resources introduce this powerful technology for scholarly communications librarianship. 

### Contents
