title: OER for Scholarly Communications Librarians
---

Websites for scholarly publications and digital scholarship projects need less infrastructure than most websites. Once the publication or project is complete, it is expected to be stable and accessible in perpetuity for consumption and citation. Static websites provide the durability we expect from scholarship. 

In academic contexts, static websites have been the technology of choice for [conference websites](https://2020.code4lib.org/), [digitization projects](https://ocul.on.ca/topomaps/), [archival metadata](http://hillelarnold.com/staticAid/), [academic journals](http://archipelagosjournal.org/), [edited monographs](https://www.getty.edu/publications/mummyportraits/), and [open textbooks](https://moderndive.com/). 

Unlike conventional publishing platforms or services, static websites involve much lower hosting and maintenance costs. The trade-off, however, is that it takes a bit more technical knowledge to get started. These resources introduce this powerful technology for scholarly communications librarianship. 

## Contents

**Tutorials**

- Quick guide on using GitHub for OER publishing
- Deep dive on static site generators for scholarly publishing

**Teaching Resources**

- A [lesson plan](/lesson-plan/) containing learning objectives, key concepts, and activities on how static websites relate to scholarly communications librarianship.

- An [annotated bibliography](/bibiliography/) of writings and examples for anyone interested in learning about static websites in academic contexts. 


## Why make static websites for scholarly communication?

- They **support a variety of digital scholarship and scholarly communications use cases**, including scholarly monographs, academic journals, digital exhibits, reproducible research, open educational resources, data visualizations, and digital library projects. 

- They are **built on open source software and open web standards**. There's nothing proprietary to the underlying technologies.

- They can be **hosted anywhere**, enabling the freedom to deploy to (and migrate from) any hosting provider. 

- They rely on **fewer pieces of technical infrastructure** than dynamic web platforms: no databases, no software updates, no server maintenance, no security patches

- They are **cheaper to maintain and preserve**

## What are the drawbacks?

- They are more difficult to learn. Static websites don't typically include a content management system. Instead, they require direct interaction [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) files via a text editor and command line interface. 

- They are more difficult to edit after the work is complete. For scholarly publications and digital scholarship projects, frequent editing and updating may not be a primary concern, but projects involving many content editors with on-the-fly content updates may be better served by a publishing platform with a content management system. 

- They do not support "logged in" user experiences. Static websites are easiest to make when they are public and read-only. Administrative dashboards, analytics, submission management systems, and subscriber content would need to be handled using other services.
