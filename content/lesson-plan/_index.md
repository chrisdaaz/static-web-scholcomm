## Scholarly Communications Class on Static Websites

This lesson plan is designed for a workshop or class session on static website technologies for scholarly communications librarianship. Static websites are low-cost and low-maintenance alternatives to comprehensive publishing platforms for open access literature and open educational resources. 

###  Objectives

At the end of this session, participants will be able to:

- Identify examples of open infrastructure for scholarly communications

- Describe the differences between static and dynamic websites 

- Recommend web publishing options to students and faculty

- Produce and transform plain-text documents for editing, publishing, and archiving


**Static websites and digital humanities**

Read: Gil, Alex. 2015. “The User, the Learner and the Machines We Make · Minimal Computing.” Minimal Computing: A Working Group of GO::DH. May 21, 2015. https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/.

Activity: 

- Read "[Getting Started with Markdown](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0046)" to learn the basic syntax
- Write a markdown version of your resume/CV in a text editor (such as [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/))
- Convert your resume/CV from markdown to HTML5 with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/try/) 
- Save the HTML5 code to a file called `resume-cv.html`

**JAMstack**

JAMstack is an architecture for building static websites with dynamic features. JAMstack separates the front-end interface from the backend database in order to produce websites that are less vulnerable to software degredation and security risks. When publishing scholarly texts online, scholarly communications librarians rarely need backend database features. We really only need the frontend to provide stable, unlimited online access to web publications. 

| Frontend Features | Backend Features |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Public HTML interface | Server-rendered web pages |
| Metadata (JSON/HTML) | Storing user credentials |
| Full-text PDF download | Managing e-commerce transactions |

Activity:

- Watch at least first 6 minutes of "[What is the JAMstack? and let's BUILD one](https://youtu.be/Sh1i-gMH4bo)"

- Examine three publishing tools from the Catalogue in “[Mind the Gap: A Landscape Analysis of Open Source Publishing Tools and Platforms](https://mindthegap.pubpub.org/)” and make a case for why each tool is or is not an example of JAMstack in scholarly communications. 

**Open Infrastructure for Scholarly Communications**

Read: Skinner, Katherine. 2019. “Why Are So Many Scholarly Communication Infrastructure Providers Running a Red Queen’s Race? | Educopia Institute.” July 23, 2019. https://educopia.org/red-queens-race/.

Discussion: In what ways do static websites address or complicate the impediments to sustaining scholarly communication resources Skinner outlines?
