# Static Web Technologies as Open Infrastructure for Scholarly Communications: A Lesson Plan

## Introduction

This lesson plan describes a course module for introducing static website technologies for scholarly communications librarianship. 

Static website technologies include static site generators, markdown, Git, and content delivery networks. The “Invest in Open Infrastructure” concept defines open infrastructure as community-driven “services, protocols, standards and software” supporting the unrestricted distribution of scholarly literature, educational materials, and research data (1). Static website technologies are examples of open infrastructure because they are open source software, they rely on fundamental web standards and protocols, they are invulnerable to vendor lock-in, they are widely available and affordable, and they support a variety of scholarly communications use cases.



## Learning Objectives

After completing this course module, librarians will be able to:

- Describe the differences between static and dynamic websites in order to select appropriate technologies for supporting scholarly web publications

- Investigate open source static site generators for use in library-publishing contexts
